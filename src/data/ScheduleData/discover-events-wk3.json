    "desc": "This hands-on workshop explores the fundamentals of persistent storage in Kubernetes from an end-user perspective. Learn how to create persistent volume claims (PVC), snapshots and clones, resize volumes, attach raw block volumes and understand the properties of StorageClass objects and working with PVC annotations to tweak behavior of the underlying storage to optimize performance for different workload types. Prior Kubernetes knowledge is helpful, but not necessary as the instructor will walk through different examples during the session.",
