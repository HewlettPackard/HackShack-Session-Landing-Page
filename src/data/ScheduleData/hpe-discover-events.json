    "desc": "Whether its facial recognition or self-driving cars, CNNs are used everywhere. Join this hands-on workshop to learn how to implement a simple CNN for a Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST). Using an MNIST dataset (70,000 pictures of hand-written digits) you’ll learn how to build a simple CNN and train it to solve a real problem with Keras (a deep learning library for Python.) On completion, you’ll be able to predict a digit, given a picture of hand-written digits with 99% accuracy.",

    "desc": "You may know that application programming interfaces (APIs) allow applications to talk to other apps, but have you ever used them? Today, APIs are available for most products and solutions. You can take advantage of them when writing automation scripts, integrating code or defining infrastructure-as-code, as long as you understand the mechanisms used to consume an API. In this hands-on workshop, we’ll review all the jargon and technology used by REST APIs and show you how to place your first API call against a publicly available API.",

This latter challenge alone can stymie AI initiatives, as organizations struggle to make decisions about investing in the right technologies to serve their needs. In this session, we’ll discuss how breaking down an AI solution into workflow steps can help system administrators, data scientists and business leaders better understand the AI technology landscape.",
