    "desc": "This challenge is undoubtedly the most complicated one as it's an end-to-end developer experience. Your mission here will be to build a Grommet sample app (or reuse the one from the Grommet Challenge), package it in a container, and then run that container in a Kubernetes Cluster. This challenge touches on several technologies, such as front-end web application design, Docker containers and Kubernetes. Be ready for an intense moment when all the pieces of the puzzle will suddenly make total sense.",

Beginner through expert designers and developers are all welcome. This challenge is all about unleashing your creativity!",
