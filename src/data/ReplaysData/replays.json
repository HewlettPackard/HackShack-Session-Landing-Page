    "desc": "Calling all developers, data analysts and IT architects. Learn how to interact with the HPE Container Platform programmatically through its REST API. In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn how to perform authentication, deploy distributed multi-mode applications for AI/ML and data analytics and interpret/respond to REST API calls. We'll walk you through, step by step, and, by the end of the session, you'll be deploying a TensorFlow application framework and other simple applications. No previous programming experience required.",

By implementing the HPE Container Platform with its easy-to-use APIs, new clusters and software applications can be created automatically with specified resources. Join this hands-on workshop to learn how the HPE Container Platform APIs make it easier to configure apps and compute resources, along with how to pull detailed usage reports for chargeback/showback.",

    "desc": "You may know that application programming interfaces (APIs) allow applications to talk to other apps, but have you ever used them? Today, APIs are available for most products and solutions. You can take advantage of them when writing automation scripts, integrating code or defining infrastructure-as-code, as long as you understand the mechanisms used to consume an API. In this hands-on workshop, we'll review all the jargon and technology used by REST APIs and show you how to place your first API call against a publicly available API.",
